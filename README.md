# Probabilistic Machine Learning Hand-in
This is the code for our submission to the Probabilistic Machine Learning exam 2025. The repository is structured as follows:

* All code used to complete **Task A1 and A2** can be found in the Part A folder. The folder contains an individual jupyter notebook implementing each of the variations of the diffusion model, as well as a number of helper/utility functions. The model weights are also saved. 
* All code used to complete **Task B1 and B2** can be found in the Part B folder. It contains two jupyter notebooks, one corresponding to each of the tasks (and named such). 
* For reproducibility, the project report is also available as a PDF file.
